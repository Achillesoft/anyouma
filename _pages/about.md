I am **Achille Nyouma**, a lecturer and researcher in population genetics and applied genomics.  
My academic work focuses on understanding genetic diversity, modelling evolutionary processes, and applying genomic tools to improve perennial crops, especially **oil palm**.

I previously completed a 10-month postdoctoral stay at the **Polytechnic University of Madrid**, and collaborated extensively with **CIRAD Montpellier**.

I am currently preparing a **future postdoctoral project in Europe**, aiming to combine haplotype-based genomic prediction and large-scale genomic datasets from perennial species.
