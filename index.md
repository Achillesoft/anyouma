# Achille Nyouma, PhD  
Genetics and Plant Breeding  

Welcome to my academic website. I am a Senior Lecturer and Researcher in Genetics and Plant Breeding, currently based in Douala, Cameroon. My work focuses on:

- Genomic prediction and statistical modelling  
- Haplotype block construction (HaploBlocker)  
- Genetics and breeding of perennial species (oil palm)  
- Applied genomics for tropical crops  

I also share here my teaching activities, current research projects, publications, talks, and personal academic goals.
